<div class="bodystuff"><p>So if you hav learned how to shoot, then you should learn how to pump fake. Pump fake is when you pretend to shoot but you hold back,<br>
and then the second time you shoot the ball. This trick is used so you can waste the defender's energy to try to block you again.<br>
A defender will normally try to block you when he see's you going for a shot, so what you will have to do is hold the ball in the<br>
same form and then instead of shooting, you pump fake, and then the second time you shoot the ball so you have a better loot<br>
for the hoop. Many people use this trick for tricking the defender about when they will shoot, but overusing it can be bad too.<br>
Overusing this trick will let the defender know what your plan is, and he will be more aware about what you will try to do.<br>
